A. Experimental Results on the Yale Database
The Yale face database4 was constructed at the Center for
Computational Vision and Control at Yale University. There
are 165 grayscale images of 15 subjects (each individual
having 11 different images). The images include variations
in lighting conditions (right-light, center-light, and left-light),
facial expression (normal, sleepy, surprised, happy, sad, and
wink), and with/without glasses. All images were cropped and

resized to 32×32 pixels. We preprocessed the data by normal-
izing each face vector to the unit. Fig. 2 shows sample images

of one person.
Table III shows the average recognition rates of each method
and their corresponding standard deviations (std), where the
best results are highlighted in bold. There is no result for
“2 Train” of NFP since NFP requires that the number of the
training examples per class should be at least three. These
experimental results are also shown in Fig. 3. Due to space
limitations, we only present the NN, NC, NFS, linear SVM,
and DVM curves in Fig. 3. As can be seen, DVM outperforms
all other methods in all cases, while the NN method has the
poorest performance except “9 Train” and “10 Train.”
